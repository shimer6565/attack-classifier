7. Anomalous System Behavior
Alert Description: Systems behaving erratically, such as unexpected reboots or crashes, which may indicate rootkit interference.
Triage Steps:
Conduct a hardware diagnostic to rule out physical issues.
Use live OS tools to examine the system externally without relying on the potentially compromised OS.
Restore system stability by removing or disabling the rootkit.
Update all drivers and system firmware to close vulnerabilities used for rootkit entry.
