4. Persistent Malware Re-infections
Alert Description: Continuous re-infection of malware on a system despite repeated cleanups, possibly due to an undetected rootkit.
Triage Steps:
Consider the possibility of a deep-rooted rootkit and perform a thorough scan using multiple security solutions.
Examine startup items, scheduled tasks, and system hooks for anomalies.
Reformat hard drives and reinstall operating systems where re-infections persist.
Investigate and remediate the initial attack vector used to install the rootkit.
