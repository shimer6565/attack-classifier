Alert Description: Malware that uses polymorphic encryption to continually change its encrypted components, avoiding signature detection.
Triage Steps:
Apply decryption tools capable of handling polymorphic encryption.
Enhance threat intelligence platforms to identify and understand encryption patterns.
Share findings with antivirus vendors to aid in the development of detection algorithms.
Perform regular backup and recovery drills to ensure data integrity in case of an attack.
