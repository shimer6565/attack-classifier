1. Rapid Signature Changes
Alert Description: Detection of malware variants that frequently change their signatures to evade traditional antivirus detection.
Triage Steps:
Deploy advanced malware protection tools that use behavior-based detection rather than signature-based.
Increase frequency of antivirus database updates to capture as many variants as possible.
Conduct regular deep scans of all systems with multiple antivirus engines.
Isolate suspected files for analysis in a secure environment.
